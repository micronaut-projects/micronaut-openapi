This project allows generating OpenAPI 3.x (Swagger) specifications for a Micronaut application at compilation time. By moving the generation of OpenAPI specs into the compiler this project allows Micronaut applications to save on memory and avoid the need for costly computation at runtime unlike most implementations of OpenAPI which rely on processing to occur on the server.

## Snapshots and Releases

Snapshots are automatically published to [Sonatype Snapshots](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/micronaut/) using [Github Actions](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-openapi/actions).

See the documentation in the [Micronaut Docs](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#usingsnapshots) for how to configure your build to use snapshots.

Releases are published to Maven Central via [Github Actions](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-openapi/actions).

A release is performed with the following steps:

* [Publish the draft release](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-openapi/releases). There should be already a draft release created, edit and publish it. The Git Tag should start with `v`. For example `v1.0.0`.
* [Monitor the Workflow](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-openapi/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease) to check it passed successfully.
* Celebrate!
