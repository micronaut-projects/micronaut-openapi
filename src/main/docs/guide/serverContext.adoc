In the micronaut configuration file you can define a server context path (with `micronaut.server.context-path`) which serves as a base path for all routes.
Since the yaml specification file and the views are generated at compile time, these resources are not aware of changes during runtime (e.g. context-path is determined by a reverse proxy).

It is still possible for the views to work in case a context path is defined:

* Set `micronaut.openapi.server.context.path` property for compile time resolution, or
* Use a `HttpServerFilter` that will add a cookie, or
* Add a parameter to the url.

The view will first look for the cookie and if not present for the parameter.
