Micronaut includes support for producing https://www.openapis.org[OpenAPI] (Swagger) YAML at compilation time. Micronaut will at compile time produce a OpenAPI 3.x compliant YAML file just based on the regular Micronaut annotations and the javadoc comments within your code.

You can customize the generated Swagger using the standard <<swaggerAnnotations, Swagger Annotations>>.

If you wish to generate Micronaut projects from OpenAPI definition files, utilize the https://openapi-generator.tech/[OpenAPI Generator]'s Micronaut support. Refer to the https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-openapi-generator-server["Micronaut server generation with OpenAPI" guide] or the https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-openapi-generator-client["Micronaut Client generation with OpenAPI" guide] for details.
