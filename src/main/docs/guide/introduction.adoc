Micronaut includes support for producing https://www.openapis.org[OpenAPI] (Swagger) YAML at compilation time. Micronaut will at compile time produce a OpenAPI 3.x compliant YAML file just based on the regular Micronaut annotations and the javadoc comments within your code.

You can customize the generated Swagger using the standard <<swaggerAnnotations, Swagger Annotations>>.
