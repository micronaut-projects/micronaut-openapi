The path from where the swagger specification will be served by the http server defaults to `swagger`. You can change it via the `mapping.path` property.

Thus, by default, the views expect to find the `yaml` under `/swagger`.

If you change this mapping to something else:

.Exposing Swagger YAML
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
    router:
        static-resources:
            swagger:
                paths: classpath:META-INF/swagger
                mapping: /swaggerYAML/**
----
You will need to set the `mapping.path` property accordingly: `micronaut.openapi.views.spec=mapping.path=swaggerYAML...`.
