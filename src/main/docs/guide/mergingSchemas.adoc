Often times you might want to generate OpenAPI (Swagger) YAML for built-in endpoints or paths from some other modules, such as `security`. In order to generate YAML including all that information, Micronaut supports merging of multiple OpenAPI YAML files. So, you can create OpenAPI YAML files manually at some predefined path from where the information will then be merged into the final YAML file.

For example, if you are using https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html#openid[Micronaut's Security OpenID Connect] with https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/[Amazon Cognito] your application exposes several endpoints which you could define in an external OpenAPI YAML file such as:

[source,yaml]
.openapi/oauth.yml
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: OAuth
  description: Endpoints related to the integration with Amazon Cognito
  version: "1.0"
paths:
  /logout:
    get:
      tags:
      - security
      description: deletes the JWT cookie and redirects to /oauth/login/cognito
      operationId: logout
      parameters: []
      responses:
        "200":
          description: logout 200 response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Object'
        "302":
          links:
            oauth-login-cognito:
              operationId: oauth-login-cognito
  /oauth/callback/cognito:

      tags:

      description: receives a callback from the authorization server with a code to

        url: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/token-endpoint.html
      operationId: oauth-callback-cognito
      parameters:
      - name: authorizationResponse
        in: query
        required: true
        explode: true
        schema:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/AuthorizationResponse'
      responses:
        "303":
          description: redirects to home page upon successful completion of the authorization
            code grant flow
          headers:
            Set-Cookie:
              description: Cookied named JWT with the id token obtained from the authorization
                server as the value
  /oauth/login/cognito:
    get:
      tags:

      description: redirects to authorization server sign in page
      externalDocs:
        description: Amazon Cognito Authorization Endpoint documentation
        url: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authorization-endpoint.html
      operationId: oauth-login-cognito
      parameters: []
      responses:
        "302":
          description: redirects to authorization server sign in page
  /oauth/logout:
    get:
      tags:
      - security
      description: ends the session in the authorization server and the redirects
        to /logout
      externalDocs:

        url: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/logout-endpoint.html
      operationId: oauth-logout
      parameters: []
      responses:
        "302":
          links:
            logout:
              operationId: logout

  schemas:
    AuthorizationResponse:
      required:

      - state
      type: object
      properties:

          required:
          - "true"
          type: string
          description: an authorization code which the OAuth 2.0 client can exchange

        nonce:

          type: string
          nullable: true
        state:
          required:
          - "true"
          type: string    
----

You could also have a yaml file describing the endpoint which exposes the generated OpenAPI YAML file:

[source,yaml]
.openapi/swagger.yml
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: swagger
  version: "1.0"
paths:
  /swagger/demo-0.0.yml:
    get:
      tags:
        - openapi
      description: returns the OpenAPI YAML file describing the API
      operationId: swagger
      parameters: []
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OpenAPI YAML file describing the API
          content:
            text/plain: {}
----

To merge both files with the generated OpenAPI definition point Micronaut to look for additional OpenAPI yaml files in the `openapi` folder. You need to set the property `micronaut.openapi.additional.files`. 

[source,bash]
.openapi.properties
----
micronaut.openapi.additional.files=openapi
...
..
.
----

Micronaut will include the endpoints defined in those files in the generated output.
