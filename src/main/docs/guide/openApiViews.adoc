Micronaut can generate views for your generated OpenApi specification. Currently https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui[Swagger-ui], https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc[Redoc] and https://github.com/mrin9/RapiDoc[RapiDoc] are supported.
You can also use https://mrin9.github.io/RapiPdf/[RapiPdf] to generate a PDF from your spec file.

You can enable multiple views generation in a single application.

The resources needed to render the views (javascript, css, ...) are loaded from CDNs: https://unpkg.com[unpkg.com] and https://fonts.googleapis.com/[fonts.googleapis.com].
