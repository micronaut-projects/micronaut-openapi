If you have some classes with same names in different packages you can set postfix like this:

[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  openapi:
    schema-postfix:
      org.api.v1_0_0: 1_0_0
      org.api.v2_0_0: 2_0_0
----

or by system properties:

```
-Dmicronaut.openapi.schema-postfix.org.api.v1_0_0=1_0_0 -Dmicronaut.openapi.schema-postfix.org.api.v2_0_0=2_0_0
```

or by openapi.properties

```properties
micronaut.openapi.schema-postfix.org.api.v1_0_0=1_0_0
micronaut.openapi.schema-postfix.org.api.v2_0_0=2_0_0
```

NOTE: Important!
After changing these settings, a complete recompilation of the project is necessary to ensure that the new settings are applied correctly.
