To create a project with OpenAPI/Swagger support using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `openapi` feature to the `features` flag. For example:

----
$ mn create-app my-openapi-app --features openapi
----

This will create a project with the minimum necessary configuration for OpenAPI.

If you have already created a Micronaut project and will like to add Swagger support, you can simply follow instructions in subsequent sections.
