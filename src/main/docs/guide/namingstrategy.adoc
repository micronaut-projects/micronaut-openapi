You can control how the Schema property names are dumped by setting the `micronaut.openapi.property.naming.strategy` system property. It accepts one of
the following *jackson*'s `PropertyNamingStrategy`:

* *LOWER_CAMEL_CASE*
* *UPPER_CAMEL_CASE*
* *SNAKE_CASE*
* *UPPER_SNAKE_CASE*
* *LOWER_CASE*
* *KEBAB_CASE*
* *LOWER_DOT_CASE*.
