If you wish to expose the generated OpenAPI yaml output from your running application you can simply add the necessary static resource to the application configuration. For example:

.Exposing OpenAPI YAML
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
    router:
        static-resources:
            swagger:
                paths: classpath:META-INF/swagger
                mapping: /swagger/**
----

With the above configuration in place when you run your application you can access your Swagger documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger/hello-world-0.0.yml`.
