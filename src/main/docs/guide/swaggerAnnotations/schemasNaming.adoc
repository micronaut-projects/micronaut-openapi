By default Micronaut uses Class simple name for Custom type schemas. Micronaut use simple name no matter if `@Schema`
annotation is defined on type or on property (getter). That means that if you have two properties of same type with `@Schema`
annotation without `name` set, Micronaut will accidentally override one definition with another. So in that case you should
set `name` on `@Schema` annotation.

<1> Micronaut will generate schema with name `Pet`
<2> Micronaut will generate schema with name `Pet` since name is not set, this will conflict with <1> and <3>, final Pet schema might be incorrect
<3> Micronaut will generate schema with name `Pet` since name is not set, this will conflict with <1> and <2>, final Pet schema might be incorrect
<4> Micronaut will generate schema with unique name `Dog` since name is set, there is no conflict, schema is correctly generated
