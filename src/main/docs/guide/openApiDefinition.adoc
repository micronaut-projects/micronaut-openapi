Once dependencies have been configured a minimum requirement is to add a `@OpenAPIDefinition` annotation to your `Application` class:

.Example @OpenAPIDefinition usage
snippet::io.micronaut.configuration.openapi.docs.Application[tags="imports,clazz", project-base="docs-examples/example"]

With that in place, you compile your project and a Swagger YAML file will be generated to the `META-INF/swagger` directory of your project's class output. For example, the above configuration generates:

* For Java `build/classes/java/main/META-INF/swagger/hello-world-0.0.yml`
* For Kotlin `build/tmp/kapt3/classes/main/META-INF/swagger/hello-world-0.0.yml`

The previously defined annotations will produce YAML like the following:
